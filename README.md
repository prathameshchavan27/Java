# 📚 Java Learning 

Welcome to my Java Learning Repository! This space is dedicated to my journey in mastering Java through hands-on projects. Here, you'll find a collection of small case study projects, including Customer Management and Vehicle Management systems. Each project is designed to reinforce my understanding of core Java concepts while providing practical applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview

### 1. Customer Management System
This project simulates a customer management application where users can:
- Add, update, and delete customer records.
- Search for customers by various criteria.
- Manage customer information efficiently.

**Key Features:**
- User-friendly interface
- Data validation
- File storage for persistent data management

### 2. Vehicle Management System
In this project, I created a vehicle management application that allows users to:

1. **Add Vehicle to the Showroom**:
   - Accepts vehicle data and validates all inputs.
   - On success, the vehicle is added; otherwise, it throws a built-in or custom exception.

2. **Display All Vehicle Details**:
   - Lists all vehicles currently in the showroom.

3. **Get Vehicle Details**:
   - Input: Chassis number.
   - Output: Vehicle details or an error message via a custom exception if not found.

4. **Apply Discount on All Vehicles of a Specific Color**:
   - Input: Color and percentage discount.
   - Output: A suitable message indicating success or failure.

5. **Purchase Vehicle**:
   - Facilitates the purchase process for users looking to buy a vehicle.

**Key Features:**
- Robust data validation
- Exception handling for error management
- Simple command-line interface for interaction

## 🌟 Learning Objectives

Through these projects, I aimed to:
- Understand object-oriented programming principles (OOP).
- Implement data structures effectively.
- Gain experience with file handling and data persistence.
- Enhance problem-solving skills through real-world scenarios.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java SE**: Core programming language for all projects.
- **Eclipse STS/IntelliJ IDEA**: IDEs used for development.
- **Git**: Version control for managing project updates.
